The idea that one could acquire the skills needed to enter the software industry in a matter of weeks, not years, is very alluring to outsiders. But how efficient are those programs and how successful are their graduates? To answer these questions, we need to factor for the quality of the bootcamp, as well as preparedness & motivation of the candidate.</p><h3>Before the bootcamp</h3><p>It’s no secret to anyone the vast list of reasons why you would want to become a software engineer: high compensation, remote work, good work/life balance etc. But in my opinion these reasons attract people that would normally not enjoy sitting on a computer, staring at a screen, solving bugs, coming with solutions all day long. My recommendation to prospective candidates would be to take a few beginner courses on programming and get a feel of the material. That way, they can prepare for the possibility of enrolling into a program, while at the same time they can make a decision if coding is actually something they are genuinely interested in.</p><h3>Choosing the bootcamp</h3><p>There are so many programs out there, some of them good, most of them bad, and it can feel overwhelming when it comes to making a choice. It’s kind of like buying a car — you need to trust that it will be reliable and also that you’ll enjoy its features. You have probably heard the saying “you get what you pay for” and this is true in the coding bootcamp world as well. Some of the programs are very expensive, but they just happen to have the best results when it comes to job placement post-graduation. There’s different styles and intensity: some have a remote “live” format where you tune in virtually for lectures, have access to a chat to connect with your cohort. Others might be having slower intensity, also known as a “flex” format. The idea with that is that you’d be self-paced. Usually that means it would take longer time to go through the curriculum. Another format is an in-person program. That means you would have a classroom setting with instructors and your peers, which makes for easy collaboration. My advice:</p><ol><li>Choose a stack of technologies that you believe will have the best prospects in the future. Then stick with it until you learn the fundamentals of software development. Things move fast in the coding world and what tech was used 5 years ago may not be what’s used today. Our goal as software engineers is to adapt quickly to changes and never be left behind.</li><li>Choose the intensity that best suits your learning style and life situation. Sure it would be nice to finish in the least amount of time, but if that means you would be skimming through the material just to pass the challenges and tests, it might not be the best idea.</li></ol><h3>Attending the Bootcamp</h3><p>Ok, you have done some courses and have decided that, maybe, coding is for you. You have done your due diligence and have settled on a program that you like. What now?</p><ol><li>Show up everyday. This rings especially true for the live programs that have a higher intensity. Don’t let yesterday’s work be left for tomorrow, because soon enough you will find yourself overwhelmed and that’s not cool.</li><li>Take care of your mental and physical state! Can’t stress this enough. Eat food. Drink water. Go to bed early. Limit partying to Friday/Saturday. Take walks regularly. The mere fact of you being outside, breathing fresh air, (hopefully) basking in some sunshine, not staring at pixels will do wonders for your brain and your capacity to absorb info.</li><li>Give it your 100%! It’s time to prove to yourself that through vigor and enthusiasm, you can accomplish great things.</li></ol><h3>After Graduation</h3><p>You’ve done the hard part! Or have you? Well, it’s time you dip your feet in the cold water, a.k.a the job market. Start applying for jobs. Looking for a job is a full-time endeavor. Treat it as such. You will need to excel in order to secure a position. This means that the work is not done. You need to keep building upon your skills and improving. Keep working on your projects. As a bootcamp grad and not having any past experience, your projects are the single most important aspect of your education. Make sure you have at least 1 really well polished project that you have built from the grounds up. Make sure you can talk about it at length and explain the flow of data across the application. Don’t give up! It might get discouraging after a few rejections. But take every turn down as a learning opportunity: figure out where you lacked and improve. Be patient, keep at it and you shall be rewarded.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=be3f33cd7c37\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">",

Having just <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/podcast/the-role-models-podcast/id1234400489?l=en&mt=2\">started my own interview podcast</a>, I listen to The Turnaround with the intent to learn from some of the best and most experienced interviewers.</p><p>Below is a summary of my favorite pro tips as shared by the first three guests on The Turnaround: <a href=\"http://www.susanorlean.com/\">Susan Orlean</a>, <a href=\"https://www.thisamericanlife.org/\">Ira Glass</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.wtfpod.com/\">Marc Maron</a>.</p><h3>Susan Orlean</h3><p><a href=\"http://www.maximumfun.org/turnaround/susan-orlean\"><em>Susan Orlean</em></a><em> is a staff writer of The New Yorker and host of the </em><a href=\"http://www.earwolf.com/show/crybabies/\"><em>Crybabies</em></a><em> podcast.</em></p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*hjZYc591qO6dU3u96KUx7Q.jpeg\" /></figure><p>Rather than entering a conversation from the perspective of a journalist who has a series of questions, Susan Orlean approaches each interview with the goal to have her guests teach her about what it is that they have mastered over time.</p><p>Susan is both a writer and a broadcaster and there is a difference in the role she plays depending on the context. In her role as a writer she is the story teller and as a broadcaster it’s not her but her guest who is the story teller. Her role then as a broadcaster is to guide her guest through their own story instead of telling it for them.</p><p>What was surprising to me was to learn that Susan never prepares questions in advance. She walks into a conversation or interview with curiosity rather than preparation. She trusts that the guest knows their story best and she focuses on getting them to share it without a preconceived notion.</p><blockquote>“Most of the stories that I do end up not being at all what I thought they are going to be. I take that as a good sign. I go into it thinking–well, I am going to find out about X, and actually, if I’m really open, and really listening, and really paying attention, the real story emerges. The one that I couldn’t have anticipated. And that’s what I’m following.”</blockquote><p>The crucial skill to be successful with this approach is to be a fast thinker:</p><blockquote>“Being good at thinking on your feet is essential, because you’re diving into something you don’t know what you’ll encounter.”</blockquote><p>On the question whether or not she uses quotes verbatim, she replies, passionately:</p><blockquote>“Oh yeah, oh yeah! I cannot state strongly enough that is utterly totally unethical. It’s a lie. If you put a line in quotation marks and attribute to someone something they actually didn’t say, it’s a lie. It’s an absolute lie. If you didn’t quite get all the words of the quote down, then paraphrase it. If you feel sure you know the intent of what they said, but the quote isn’t–you didn’t get the words down, paraphrase it. I feel strongly about it.”</blockquote><p>Her secret pro tip to interviewing that all interviewers should master: listening.</p><blockquote>“Be a listener. Be a good listener. And sit with your discomfort, which is part of what listening requires. Those long silences, the moments where you aren’t exactly sure what you’re doing or a person is not responding right away. It’s not easy but you have to learn to live with that and listen and be in the moment.”</blockquote><h3>Ira Glass</h3><p><a href=\"http://www.maximumfun.org/turnaround/ira-glass\"><em>Ira Glass</em></a><em> is a public radio personality and the host and producer of </em><a href=\"https://www.thisamericanlife.org\"><em>This American Life</em></a><em>.</em></p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*HofD28ErmTjALru6htcwQw.jpeg\" /></figure><p>Almost exactly the opposite approach to Susan, Ira Glass is always prepared.

This creates what he calls a “narrative suspense” — or a forward motion of ideas which leads people to want to listen to what’s next, a powerful tool for journalism.</p><p>A technique he uses to receive affirmation for what he heard is to play back to the interviewee what he thinks their story means.

      "content": "<p><em>One of the hardest things I learned from 8 years at SoundCloud was to transition from being an individual contributor to becoming a manager and eventually a leader in the senior management team of a company of 350+ employees.</em></p><p>Here are 10 things I learned from 8 years at SoundCloud (hint: #10 is my personal favorite):</p><h3>#1 Build a system, not an empire</h3><p>Empires need control, expansion, and defense. Systems, when built correctly, can sustain themselves, run autonomously and evolve through the contribution of its… well, contributors. My role as a leader was to build a system, not an empire.</p><p>Building a system meant to identify the pieces needed to fulfill a certain purpose, to assemble all the parts necessary (standards, people, processes, policies, etc) to fulfill it, and then to remove myself from the system I built as fast as possible to see if it can outlive me without falling apart. If it could, my job was done and I could move on to the next purpose. If it couldn’t, I had to step back into it and make sure all the right pieces were in place and make some adjustments.</p><h3>#2 Your company values do not mean a thing unless your leaders fully embody them</h3><p>I am a mission and values-driven leader and I believe that the right set of values can be a powerful instrument to consult for guidance. The important (and often hardest) part about company values is to break them from an aspirational level to a practical level. When lived properly, you will witness a behavior and be able to link it to one of your company’s values.</p><p>At SoundCloud, I had the privilege of being involved in developing our first set of of values and then recently of leading the effort to refresh our values and I’ve seen first-hand how powerful values can be as a leadership tool.</p><p>Effective (and successful) leaders, I’ve found, embody all of your company’s values entirely, and then model how those values are lived day in, day out, on a behavioral level. You don’t badge values, you live them.</p><h3>#3 “Be impeccable with your word”</h3><p>This is a sentence borrowed from the book ‘<a href=\"http://www.toltecspirit.com/\">The Four Agreements’ by Don Miguel Ruiz</a> and describes what is referred to in a work setting as accountability. Do what you say you will do. Say something, commit to it, communicate it, do it, report back to close the loop. It’s an obvious trait of great leaders but is often easier said than done.</p><p>To be a great leader, find a process that works for you to hold yourself (and others!) accountable. What works for me, for example, is to use my calendar as a reminder and to add follow-up notes. Super easy and low effort once you get into the swing.</p><h3>#4 Become a context-gathering and context-distributing machine</h3><p>In a fast-paced environment, context trumps control. If you invest heavily in hiring and retaining the best talent–and expect them to do their best work–equip them with all the context and information you have. If you entrust your people with all the information they need to do their job, it will enable them to do their best work autonomously.</p><p>Provide your people–consistently and continuously–with context and information about strategy, priorities, decisions, changes, and resources and they will go and deliver great work. From One-on-Ones to company All Hands meetings, use every opportunity to provide context.</p><h3>#5 Practice radical self-inquiry</h3><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/jerrycolonna\">Jerry Colonna</a> is a coach we have worked with at SoundCloud and who helps leaders, executives, and founders unlock their full potential. In working with leaders, Jerry uses the term called <a href=\"https://www.reboot.io/about/coaches/\">“radical self-inquiry”</a>, a deep exploration of self. This — often scary — journey requires the leader to be open and transparent, to be self-aware, and most importantly, to be honest to themselves.</p><p>The leaders I have seen being successful all have demonstrated the willingness to be or become aware leaders–aware of their strengths and styles, their weaknesses and fears, and able to verbalize them in a productive and positive way.</p><h3>#6 Don’t solve problems. Instead, enable problem-solvers</h3><p>As a contributor you contribute, you solve problems, you’re the doer. As a manager or leader that suddenly changes and it can be the most counter-intuitive transition you face. Suddenly your job is to stop doing and instead, to enable the doing. The reason this is counter-intuitive is because you associate much of the value you create as an employee with what you do. And when you become a manager, the value suddenly shifts to a different kind of doing, which feels more detached from the actual work. The faster you can transition through this dynamic, the better it is for your team.</p><p>Great leaders don’t just sit on the sidelines and point to the problems, great leaders step up and mobilize their people to find and implement a solution.</p><h3>#7 Ask great questions…</h3><p>Great leaders ask great questions. Most often, people have the answers inside them, they just need someone to help them get to them. Instead of telling people what to do, they ask questions to help people think through a problem. In other words, they coach people through a situation rather than prescribing a solution. For example:</p><ul><li><em>What would you do?</em></li><li><em>What do you think are our options here?</em></li><li><em>What do you want to achieve?</em></li><li><em>What would be the fastest and cheapest way to solve this problem?</em></li></ul><p>The best book I’ve read that teaches a framework to use the coaching method as a leader is called ‘<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Quiet-Leadership-Steps-Transforming-Performance/dp/0060835915\">Quiet Leadership’ by David Rock</a>. This is the book I have gifted most.</p><h3>#8 … Then shut up and listen</h3><p>Listening is not waiting until the other person is done speaking. Great leaders not only speak with intent, they also listen with intent. They are active listeners. Good listeners not only hear what is being said, they understand what people mean. And they have developed a way to play it back in their own words without altering the initial meaning, or by adding their own opinion and filters, or by putting a judgement on the person. For example:</p><ul><li><em>What I heard you say is…</em></li><li><em>Am I getting it right that…</em></li><li><em>The three things that I take away from what you just said are… Am I missing anything that is important to you?</em></li></ul><p>One of the most powerful listening exercises I did during a leadership training was to listen to the other person speak for 10 minutes. This is a long time. The rules were to not interrupt, to not “mhm”, and to maintain eye contact. After completing the 10 minutes, I remembered all of the key things the person shared with me and could mirror them back. I had been fully present and attentive.</p><h3>#9 Be a people- and dot-connector</h3><p>Similarly to #4 in gathering and distributing context, as a leader you must connect with people, connect people with one another, and help people connect the dots. Successful leaders reach beyond their teams and organizations and establish healthy relationships across the business (aka break through the silos). They become relationship brokers, connectors, internal community builders. For example:</p><blockquote>“Diana, I was just speaking with Lucy in Marketing about a campaign that she is developing and I think you would find value in connecting and discussing this with her. Do you want me to ask Lucy if she’s open to connect with you about it? Perhaps there is a way for you two to collaborate.”</blockquote><p>You don’t need to identify as an extrovert to be a good connector. In fact, I’ve witnessed leaders who identify as introverts often to be to more thoughtful connectors and relationship builders.</p><p>Connecting people with one another is particularly important when integrating new employees. A great tool to use is to map out the new employee’s internal network and then broker introductions to help your new team member establish and foster healthy work relationships.</p><h3>#10. Find and use your personal fingerprint</h3><p>This lesson is one of my favorite ones because you can get creative and add a personal touch: pick your signature leadership fingerprint. My personal fingerprint as a leader was to extend small, meaningful, and honest gestures whenever I had the chance to.</p><p>For example, whenever one of my team members’ parents would visit the office, I would stop for a moment, say “Hello” to introduce myself, and then tell their parents about something great their son or daughter had done for the company, and that they can be proud of them. Another one is that I used to send someone on a different team an email and thank them for something they did, completely unexpected. Often I would forget about these gestures and someone would tell me years later that it made a huge difference for them and they never forgot. Small, meaningful, and honest gestures can have a huge and long-lasting impact.</p><p>Leadership is hard, and it can be scary. But what every company needs (and the world right now, it seems), are people who are willing to lead.</p><p>You don’t need permission to be a leader.</p><h3>Liked this?

      "content_encoded": "<p><em>One of the hardest things I learned from 8 years at SoundCloud was to transition from being an individual contributor to becoming a manager and eventually a leader in the senior management team of a company of 350+ employees.</em></p><p>Here are 10 things I learned from 8 years at SoundCloud (hint: #10 is my personal favorite):</p><h3>#1 Build a system, not an empire</h3><p>Empires need control, expansion, and defense. Systems, when built correctly, can sustain themselves, run autonomously and evolve through the contribution of its… well, contributors. My role as a leader was to build a system, not an empire.</p><p>Building a system meant to identify the pieces needed to fulfill a certain purpose, to assemble all the parts necessary (standards, people, processes, policies, etc) to fulfill it, and then to remove myself from the system I built as fast as possible to see if it can outlive me without falling apart. If it could, my job was done and I could move on to the next purpose. If it couldn’t, I had to step back into it and make sure all the right pieces were in place and make some adjustments.</p><h3>#2 Your company values do not mean a thing unless your leaders fully embody them</h3><p>I am a mission and values-driven leader and I believe that the right set of values can be a powerful instrument to consult for guidance. The important (and often hardest) part about company values is to break them from an aspirational level to a practical level. When lived properly, you will witness a behavior and be able to link it to one of your company’s values.</p><p>At SoundCloud, I had the privilege of being involved in developing our first set of of values and then recently of leading the effort to refresh our values and I’ve seen first-hand how powerful values can be as a leadership tool.</p><p>Effective (and successful) leaders, I’ve found, embody all of your company’s values entirely, and then model how those values are lived day in, day out, on a behavioral level. You don’t badge values, you live them.</p><h3>#3 “Be impeccable with your word”</h3><p>This is a sentence borrowed from the book ‘<a href=\"http://www.toltecspirit.com/\">The Four Agreements’ by Don Miguel Ruiz</a> and describes what is referred to in a work setting as accountability. Do what you say you will do. Say something, commit to it, communicate it, do it, report back to close the loop. It’s an obvious trait of great leaders but is often easier said than done.</p><p>To be a great leader, find a process that works for you to hold yourself (and others!) accountable. What works for me, for example, is to use my calendar as a reminder and to add follow-up notes. Super easy and low effort once you get into the swing.</p><h3>#4 Become a context-gathering and context-distributing machine</h3><p>In a fast-paced environment, context trumps control. If you invest heavily in hiring and retaining the best talent–and expect them to do their best work–equip them with all the context and information you have. If you entrust your people with all the information they need to do their job, it will enable them to do their best work autonomously.</p><p>Provide your people–consistently and continuously–with context and information about strategy, priorities, decisions, changes, and resources and they will go and deliver great work. From One-on-Ones to company All Hands meetings, use every opportunity to provide context.</p><h3>#5 Practice radical self-inquiry</h3><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/jerrycolonna\">Jerry Colonna</a> is a coach we have worked with at SoundCloud and who helps leaders, executives, and founders unlock their full potential. In working with leaders, Jerry uses the term called <a href=\"https://www.reboot.io/about/coaches/\">“radical self-inquiry”</a>, a deep exploration of self. This — often scary — journey requires the leader to be open and transparent, to be self-aware, and most importantly, to be honest to themselves.</p><p>The leaders I have seen being successful all have demonstrated the willingness to be or become aware leaders–aware of their strengths and styles, their weaknesses and fears, and able to verbalize them in a productive and positive way.</p><h3>#6 Don’t solve problems. Instead, enable problem-solvers</h3><p>As a contributor you contribute, you solve problems, you’re the doer. As a manager or leader that suddenly changes and it can be the most counter-intuitive transition you face. Suddenly your job is to stop doing and instead, to enable the doing. The reason this is counter-intuitive is because you associate much of the value you create as an employee with what you do. And when you become a manager, the value suddenly shifts to a different kind of doing, which feels more detached from the actual work. The faster you can transition through this dynamic, the better it is for your team.</p><p>Great leaders don’t just sit on the sidelines and point to the problems, great leaders step up and mobilize their people to find and implement a solution.</p><h3>#7 Ask great questions…</h3><p>Great leaders ask great questions. Most often, people have the answers inside them, they just need someone to help them get to them. Instead of telling people what to do, they ask questions to help people think through a problem. In other words, they coach people through a situation rather than prescribing a solution. For example:</p><ul><li><em>What would you do?</em></li><li><em>What do you think are our options here?</em></li><li><em>What do you want to achieve?</em></li><li><em>What would be the fastest and cheapest way to solve this problem?</em></li></ul><p>The best book I’ve read that teaches a framework to use the coaching method as a leader is called ‘<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Quiet-Leadership-Steps-Transforming-Performance/dp/0060835915\">Quiet Leadership’ by David Rock</a>. This is the book I have gifted most.</p><h3>#8 … Then shut up and listen</h3><p>Listening is not waiting until the other person is done speaking. Great leaders not only speak with intent, they also listen with intent. They are active listeners. Good listeners not only hear what is being said, they understand what people mean.

This is a long time. The rules were to not interrupt, to not “mhm”, and to maintain eye contact.

We learned a hard lesson once we defined our values: the importance of communicating and embedding them so that they become a framework for guiding decision-making and consultation as well as a neutral instrument to encourage behaviors that are <em>on</em> culture and <em>on</em> values. It’s when you truly live values — rather than just badge them — that you see an effect on your company culture.</p><p>When I ask people what they love about working at SoundCloud, ‘the people’ is usually the first response: for many of us, working at SoundCloud means working with the smartest, most passionate and nicest people we’ve ever worked with.</p><p>The second thing SoundClouders often say makes our company a special place to work is the impact that we’re making: creating, developing and supporting a great product for music & audio creators and listeners alike.

It was the first time since my mom passed that I had been by myself. It was hard. The support of family and friends had kept me in a haze and had distracted me from dealing with the pain of the loss. Now, I cried a lot. I slept a lot. I wrote a lot. I smoked a lot. The pain was a pain that I had never felt before. It had no measure. It was a new pain. It was like feeling all the feelings, and all the emotions all at the same time, in a constant non-orchestrated overdrive.</p><h4>Thinking It Through</h4><p>It was a new year. It was Year One without my mom. My thoughts steered away from new year’s resolutions. I had always been bad at defining — and more importantly sticking to — resolutions. So I never defined them in the first place.</p><p>A question kept bugging me that I’d asked a friend a few days earlier: <em>“Can you train willpower?”</em>. Her answer was that if you think of willpower as a muscle, you can in fact train it.</p><p>To me, quitting smoking had always been a question of willpower. Turns out that was only half of the truth.</p><p>From willpower, I moved on to listing a set of personal growth challenges.

In particular those that involve an addiction. Knowing that I found it difficult to stick to resolutions, I wanted to be sure that I could succeed at something that I had elevated to the top of the list.</p><h4>The Breakthrough</h4><p>How could I be successful at quitting a habit that I loved, and a habit that I was addicted to? A habit that I had tried and failed to stop twice before.</p><p>And then It hit me.</p><p><strong>It was not about changing a habit, it was about changing who I am.</strong></p><p>Smoking was part of my identity. I was known for it. It was who I am. I was a smoker.</p><p>I started another list and wrote down what kind of person I wanted to be in the future. The list included many traits and habits of a person I could imagine myself to be one day. Nowhere on this list did it say “smoker”.</p><p>I was on to something. Our identity defines our behaviors. Who we are defines what we do. My future self was not a smoker. Hence, I would not smoke. But which future? Short-, mid-, or long-term future?</p><p>The answer: January 11th. Three months to the day after my mom had passed. I had 5 days. It was an important date. It would be the day that I would transform my identify from smoker to non-smoker. It was exhilarating and excruciating at the same time.</p><p>Enter willpower. Willpower became my companion to prepare to become a non-smoker. I defined micro-goals: I started with an allowance of 5 cigarettes that I could smoke at specific times throughout the day. Every day, I removed one cigarette from the allowance. I decided that I would smoke the last cigarette in a small ceremony on the beach on my last night as a smoker.</p><p>I smoked my last cigarette in the evening on January 10th. The next morning I woke up a non-smoker.</p><h4>Anticipating Obstacles</h4><p>That day, I woke up proud and determined. I was convinced that if I could make it through this first day, every next day would be possible too.</p><p>One thing that smokers will tell you is that they love smoking when they drink alcohol. People who usually don’t smoke will smoke the occasional cigarette in social situations from time to time. I knew that the combination of cigarettes and alcohol was a great one so I wanted to stress-test my new identity by putting myself out there.</p><p>I was still in Colombia and joined a group of backpackers out to party. We drank and we laughed and we danced. People around me smoked. Many did. I became more aware of people smoking. Only a few days prior and I would have smoked to enjoy the party. That night, though, was different. I sat there, smiling, realizing that I was a non-smoker now and that I was enjoying the party regardless.</p><p>Shortly after midnight I went to bed. I had made it through my first day (and party!) as a non-smoker.</p><p>Another thing that smokers say is that they fear that they will gain weight by compensating the loss of cigarettes with more food or candy. Knowing that, I overcame this fear by working with a trainer to design a nutrition and exercise plan for the next three months. Working with somebody was key because it made me accountable to myself <em>and</em> my trainer.</p><h4>The Impact</h4><p>A week after becoming a non-smoker, I had almost forgotten that I used to smoke 30 cigarettes a day. Two weeks later, it was strange to think that I had ever been a smoker.</p><p>My cough disappeared, my immune system got more resilient, my skin started to look healthier. I could breathe. Exercising became easier, fun even.</p><p>Life got simpler; I did not have to worry about carrying cigarettes. No need to inhale 2–3 cigarettes in a row before entering an airport or having to deal with the anxieties of a long-haul flight. Enjoying a meal at a restaurant was not interrupted by cigarette breaks. It was liberating.</p><p>Most importantly, I had discovered something about myself that I didn’t believe to be true: that I have the ability to change for the better. And most surprisingly, I am still shocked about how easy it turns out to have been.</p><p>Becoming a non-smoker has unlocked more potential for change. I apply the same principle (<em>“define your identity and the habits will follow”</em>) in other aspects of my life (more on that in a future post).</p><p>On this day today three years ago, I became a non-smoker. That’s more than 30,000 cigarettes not smoked! I have not craved a cigarette once. I will not smoke a cigarette again. Because I am a non-smoker. And non-smokers don’t smoke.</p><h4>Ten Steps to Becoming a Non-Smoker</h4><p>If you too want to become a non-smoker, here are the following 10 steps that worked for me:</p><ol><li>Write about yourself in the third person. List who you want to be in the future.</li><li>Select the one thing that feels scariest and most uncomfortable: “be a non-smoker.”</li><li>Describe and visualize the behaviors of that person — what they do and don’t do.</li><li>Pick a day in the near future. If you can, pick a symbolic date — it’s motivating.</li><li>Train your willpower: set a daily allowance of cigarettes for specific times of the day. Enjoy them consciously. Remove one each day.</li><li>Address all your inner voices and <em>“What Ifs?”</em> head-on: <em>what if I gain weight? What if I drink? What if I just smoke one here and there? </em>Become aware of them by writing them down. The voices are just that… voices.</li><li>Come the day, celebrate your last cigarette. Don’t be scared, everything will be all right. Congratulations, you are a non-smoker now.</li><li>Put yourself in social situations in which you enjoyed smoking. Become aware of the situation and start noticing how you are a different person now. Feeling proud? You can be!</li><li>Find something that you enjoy to compensate. For me it was learning about nutrition and exercise. I worked with a personal trainer for 10 sessions before going solo. And in my second year as a non-smoker, I ran three half marathons!</li><li>When in doubt, remember the core principle: <strong>who you are defines what you do.</strong></li></ol><p>If I could do it, anyone can.</p><p>—</p><p><em>A big Thank You to </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/jhedelstein\"><em>Jean Edelstein</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/dianakimball\"><em>Diana Kimball</em></a><em> for the feedback and help on this post.</em></p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=a32fb6e2d5e2\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">",

Basic state updates are done with variable reassignment, which initially feels strange coming from React, where let is a rare sight. Here’s an example in Svelte:</p><iframe src=\"\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/a26d8be41b2637630034ca2186f63837/href\">https://medium.com/media/a26d8be41b2637630034ca2186f63837/href</a></iframe><p>Clicking that button will update movies, which will then cause otherMovies to update but NOT moreMovies. Only variables defined with the reactive $: syntax (which is <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/label\">valid but arcane JavaScript</a>) will update on re-render, variables defined with const don’t. This is quite different from React, where variables update on every render unless they’re inside useEffect (and the dependencies don’t change).</p><p>The $: syntax actually works a bit like useEffect in React: anything defined with $: will update when its dependencies change, but the dependencies don’t need to be passed in — they’re automatically detected based on the variables in the definition. No useEffect dependency array, no insistent ESLint warnings.</p><p>After the initial learning curve, this is a really pleasant experience. You update state and the changes cascade through your reactive variables without needing to manage extra re-renders yourself. For all that’s been said about React’s declarative model (I’ve said it myself!), this feels far more declarative than useEffect.</p><h3>Data binding</h3><p>Svelte also has two-way data binding. This is great for reducing boilerplate with inputs and forms, but as soon as I started using it my spidey sense started tingling.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/365/1*xJ3kyFuHrZsesfB_xQA14Q.jpeg\" /><figcaption>Someone nearby is using two-way data binding!</figcaption></figure><p>The word <a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/footgun\">footgun</a> gets used a lot with two-way data binding, here’s why: two-way data binding allows (encourages?) pushing state management out into the edges of your app. Rather than a single source of truth or multiple localized sources, you have bits of state spread throughout your app affecting each other with no clear communication pattern. Imagine some state at the root of your app:</p><iframe src=\"\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/8b60da94607056311dde983fc7b0f0f0/href\">https://medium.com/media/8b60da94607056311dde983fc7b0f0f0/href</a></iframe><p>Somewhere deep in your component tree you have a component with a movies prop. Two-way data binding means when you update state in that component…</p><iframe src=\"\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/97fcc050f4821f1569af7c5360da4a98/href\">https://medium.com/media/97fcc050f4821f1569af7c5360da4a98/href</a></iframe><p>…it updates locally but <em>also updates the original state</em> and propagates the change everywhere else. Good luck keeping track of that.</p><p>This indirect management of state is problematic, but the real fun starts when you need to make updates to your data shape. When knowledge of the data shape creeps down into all the nooks and crannies of your app, it becomes cumbersome to change because you need to change every instance where that shape is used. The implementation becomes coupled with the data shape, and changes often mean you need to rework big chunks of your app.</p><p>Here’s a simple example: Your app was designed for a single user, so you have everything at the top level:</p><pre>const state = {<br>  movies: [ ... ],<br>  reviews: [ ... ],<br>  favorites: [ ... ],<br>};</pre><p>But someone hears about your app and they want in. Multiple users! Great, we’ll just update this state here…</p><pre>const state = {<br>  me: {<br>    movies: [ ... ],<br>    reviews: [ ... ],<br>    favorites: [ ... ],<br>  },<br>  you: {<br>    posts: [ ... ],<br>    reviews: [ ... ],<br>    favorites: [ ... ],<br>  }<br>};</pre><p>…and now you have to go update all the components that expect the state to be in the first shape. Hope you find them all!</p><p>Taking the time to design your state before you start will help, but over the lifetime of an app there will always be surprises. Resilient architecture optimizes for change, and a good way to do that is with encapsulation and clear interfaces. This is absolutely possible with Svelte, but you have to be intentional about it.</p><h3>The React way</h3><p>React also allows you to directly manipulate state from anywhere, but it’s not a common pattern and the data flow is clear. It’s an example of the <strong>pit of success</strong>, where it’s harder to do the wrong thing. In order to intertwine the data shape into the far reaches of your app you would have to pass setState down through layers of props, but the more common pattern is to create an interface by defining a handler alongside the state and passing that handler down.</p><p>Reducers makes this even clearer if they’re used correctly. Redux has its downsides, but one thing it gets right is separation of concerns. It encourages state management in one place (the reducer) with components sending messages (actions) about <strong>what</strong> the user did instead of <strong>how</strong> the state should update. How declarative!</p><p>Let’s head back to Svelte land. State management is a bit “anything goes,” leaving it up to the user to decide. This requires some experience to make the right choices, but the good news is Svelte is flexible. Even though it doesn’t work like React <em>by default</em>, it allows for the same patterns.</p><p>Svelte has stores, which are similar to useState, where you use set and update functions to set state. You can create a clean interface by exposing handlers instead of set/update directly. Svelte doesn’t include a reducer equivalent, but using a writable store you can create a basic useReducer in fewer than ten lines:</p><iframe src=\"\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/4233ee3f38c2a6e63ecfabd00e4ef864/href\">https://medium.com/media/4233ee3f38c2a6e63ecfabd00e4ef864/href</a></iframe><p>Svelte stores let you subscribe to updates, and in fact you can give a subscribe method to <em>anything</em> to turn it into a store. Our new store can be used like this:</p><iframe src=\"\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/445b005a1d1525e4f2fd65ffff85efad/href\">https://medium.com/media/445b005a1d1525e4f2fd65ffff85efad/href</a></iframe><p>That $store syntax is shorthand access to subscribe to the store, changes will propagate automatically.</p><h3>The takeaway</h3><p>I don’t know if I prefer React patterns because they’re objectively better, or if it’s just because I’m comfortable managing complex state using these patterns. I’m keeping an open mind that Svelte might have a clean and totally different way of managing state for large applications.</p><p>Another thing to keep in mind: <strong>this really is only an issue for large apps.</strong> For smaller apps the Svelte pattern of reactive values and let reassignment works fine. But at what point does a small app become a large one? Do you always know ahead of time, or do you open up your laptop one day and realize you’ve woven yourself into a tangled web? I like to plan for change and I like to look for ways to keep concerns separate.</p><p>You can even mix these patterns, holding some state in a reducer with reactive values derived from that state:</p><iframe src=\"\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/e1ddfd3752689c6e5ea178a549b2629a/href\">https://medium.com/media/e1ddfd3752689c6e5ea178a549b2629a/href</a></iframe><p>Is this a good idea? I’m not really sure yet. React’s guardrails make it easy to do the right thing (or at least harder to do the wrong thing), but it could also be that <em>so much </em>has been written about React state management, and Svelte is still young enough that clear patterns have yet to emerge.</p><p>Also, a note about two-way data binding: like class inheritance, it’s not intrinsically bad, it’s just been through some abuse. It’s <em>real</em> nice not to have all the boilerplate around inputs and forms, you just need to use it wisely. Similar to limiting inheritance, it’s a good idea to limit the number of layers you’re binding through (i.e. bind directly to the HTML elements rather than to other Svelte components).</p><p>One more interesting thing is how Svelte and React differ in their opinions.

Basic state updates are done with variable reassignment, which initially feels strange coming from React, where let is a rare sight. Here’s an example in Svelte:</p><iframe src=\"\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/a26d8be41b2637630034ca2186f63837/href\">https://medium.com/media/a26d8be41b2637630034ca2186f63837/href</a></iframe><p>Clicking that button will update movies, which will then cause otherMovies to update but NOT moreMovies. Only variables defined with the reactive $: syntax (which is <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/label\">valid but arcane JavaScript</a>) will update on re-render, variables defined with const don’t. This is quite different from React, where variables update on every render unless they’re inside useEffect (and the dependencies don’t change).</p><p>The $: syntax actually works a bit like useEffect in React: anything defined with $: will update when its dependencies change, but the dependencies don’t need to be passed in — they’re automatically detected based on the variables in the definition. No useEffect dependency array, no insistent ESLint warnings.</p><p>After the initial learning curve, this is a really pleasant experience. You update state and the changes cascade through your reactive variables without needing to manage extra re-renders yourself. For all that’s been said about React’s declarative model (I’ve said it myself!), this feels far more declarative than useEffect.</p><h3>Data binding</h3><p>Svelte also has two-way data binding. This is great for reducing boilerplate with inputs and forms, but as soon as I started using it my spidey sense started tingling.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/365/1*xJ3kyFuHrZsesfB_xQA14Q.jpeg\" /><figcaption>Someone nearby is using two-way data binding!</figcaption></figure><p>The word <a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/footgun\">footgun</a> gets used a lot with two-way data binding, here’s why: two-way data binding allows (encourages?) pushing state management out into the edges of your app. Rather than a single source of truth or multiple localized sources, you have bits of state spread throughout your app affecting each other with no clear communication pattern. Imagine some state at the root of your app:</p><iframe src=\"\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/8b60da94607056311dde983fc7b0f0f0/href\">https://medium.com/media/8b60da94607056311dde983fc7b0f0f0/href</a></iframe><p>Somewhere deep in your component tree you have a component with a movies prop. Two-way data binding means when you update state in that component…</p><iframe src=\"\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/97fcc050f4821f1569af7c5360da4a98/href\">https://medium.com/media/97fcc050f4821f1569af7c5360da4a98/href</a></iframe><p>…it updates locally but <em>also updates the original state</em> and propagates the change everywhere else. Good luck keeping track of that.</p><p>This indirect management of state is problematic, but the real fun starts when you need to make updates to your data shape. When knowledge of the data shape creeps down into all the nooks and crannies of your app, it becomes cumbersome to change because you need to change every instance where that shape is used. The implementation becomes coupled with the data shape, and changes often mean you need to rework big chunks of your app.</p><p>Here’s a simple example: Your app was designed for a single user, so you have everything at the top level:</p><pre>const state = {<br>  movies: [ ... ],<br>  reviews: [ ... ],<br>  favorites: [ ... ],<br>};</pre><p>But someone hears about your app and they want in. Multiple users! Great, we’ll just update this state here…</p><pre>const state = {<br>  me: {<br>    movies: [ ... ],<br>    reviews: [ ... ],<br>    favorites: [ ... ],<br>  },<br>  you: {<br>    posts: [ ... ],<br>    reviews: [ ... ],<br>    favorites: [ ... ],<br>  }<br>};</pre><p>…and now you have to go update all the components that expect the state to be in the first shape. Hope you find them all!</p><p>Taking the time to design your state before you start will help, but over the lifetime of an app there will always be surprises. Resilient architecture optimizes for change, and a good way to do that is with encapsulation and clear interfaces. This is absolutely possible with Svelte, but you have to be intentional about it.</p><h3>The React way</h3><p>React also allows you to directly manipulate state from anywhere, but it’s not a common pattern and the data flow is clear. It’s an example of the <strong>pit of success</strong>, where it’s harder to do the wrong thing. In order to intertwine the data shape into the far reaches of your app you would have to pass setState down through layers of props, but the more common pattern is to create an interface by defining a handler alongside the state and passing that handler down.</p><p>Reducers makes this even clearer if they’re used correctly. Redux has its downsides, but one thing it gets right is separation of concerns. It encourages state management in one place (the reducer) with components sending messages (actions) about <strong>what</strong> the user did instead of <strong>how</strong> the state should update. How declarative!</p><p>Let’s head back to Svelte land. State management is a bit “anything goes,” leaving it up to the user to decide. This requires some experience to make the right choices, but the good news is Svelte is flexible. Even though it doesn’t work like React <em>by default</em>, it allows for the same patterns.</p><p>Svelte has stores, which are similar to useState, where you use set and update functions to set state. You can create a clean interface by exposing handlers instead of set/update directly. Svelte doesn’t include a reducer equivalent, but using a writable store you can create a basic useReducer in fewer than ten lines:</p><iframe src=\"\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/4233ee3f38c2a6e63ecfabd00e4ef864/href\">https://medium.com/media/4233ee3f38c2a6e63ecfabd00e4ef864/href</a></iframe><p>Svelte stores let you subscribe to updates, and in fact you can give a subscribe method to <em>anything</em> to turn it into a store. Our new store can be used like this:</p><iframe src=\"\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/445b005a1d1525e4f2fd65ffff85efad/href\">https://medium.com/media/445b005a1d1525e4f2fd65ffff85efad/href</a></iframe><p>That $store syntax is shorthand access to subscribe to the store, changes will propagate automatically.</p><h3>The takeaway</h3><p>I don’t know if I prefer React patterns because they’re objectively better, or if it’s just because I’m comfortable managing complex state using these patterns. I’m keeping an open mind that Svelte might have a clean and totally different way of managing state for large applications.</p><p>Another thing to keep in mind: <strong>this really is only an issue for large apps.</strong> For smaller apps the Svelte pattern of reactive values and let reassignment works fine. But at what point does a small app become a large one? Do you always know ahead of time, or do you open up your laptop one day and realize you’ve woven yourself into a tangled web? I like to plan for change and I like to look for ways to keep concerns separate.</p><p>You can even mix these patterns, holding some state in a reducer with reactive values derived from that state:</p><iframe src=\"\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/e1ddfd3752689c6e5ea178a549b2629a/href\">https://medium.com/media/e1ddfd3752689c6e5ea178a549b2629a/href</a></iframe><p>Is this a good idea? I’m not really sure yet. React’s guardrails make it easy to do the right thing (or at least harder to do the wrong thing), but it could also be that <em>so much </em>has been written about React state management, and Svelte is still young enough that clear patterns have yet to emerge.</p><p>Also, a note about two-way data binding: like class inheritance, it’s not intrinsically bad, it’s just been through some abuse. It’s <em>real</em> nice not to have all the boilerplate around inputs and forms, you just need to use it wisely. Similar to limiting inheritance, it’s a good idea to limit the number of layers you’re binding through (i.e. bind directly to the HTML elements rather than to other Svelte components).</p><p>One more interesting thing is how Svelte and React differ in their opinions. Svelte seems to be opinionated on things like CSS and accessibility, and less so with state management, where React is the reverse. Personally I’m comfortable with the flexibility in state management (and I’m happy to let the framework make some CSS decisions), but I think it might lead newcomers down a path where things get intertwined, which could leave some people with a negative experience.</p><p>Or maybe not! These are just some observations I found interesting while working with Svelte on some projects that have grown in complexity. I haven’t made up my mind yet, but my experience with Svelte so far has been so positive that I’m really looking for ways it can scale. I see a lot of promise, and I want it to be as good as its potential.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=e4a59057b990\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/geekculture/lets-talk-about-state-management-in-svelte-e4a59057b990\">Let’s Talk About State Management in Svelte</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/geekculture\">Geek Culture</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

If it’s a group of entities of the same type/shape, or if order matters, you likely want an array.</p><p>If it’s still unclear, think about <strong>how you’ll be working with the data</strong>: manipulating individual properties? Object, probably. Doing manipulations over the data as a whole, or filtering and manipulating chunks of the data? An array, I’ll bet.</p><p>Also, if you’re working with existing data and it’s already an object or array, you probably wouldn’t convert it to another without good reason.</p><pre>// A list of ordered strings is a good case for an array:<br>const sortedNames = ['Axl', 'Billie', 'Chuck'];</pre><pre>// An item with named properties is a good case for an object:<br>const box = { height: 4, width: 3, color: 'blue' };</pre><h3>Two types of collections</h3><p>Arrays and objects are two ways of collecting data into a group. The data can be primitives (strings, numbers, booleans):</p><pre>const namesArr = ['Danny', 'Donny', 'Joey', 'Jordan', 'Jonathan'];<br>const userObj = { name: 'Jamie', age: 42 };</pre><p>…or they can be made of other arrays or objects:</p><pre>const usersArr = [{ name: 'Jim', age: 4 }, { name: 'Al', age: 62 }];<br>const miscObj = { colors: ['orange', 'red'], numbers: [1, 2, 3] };</pre><p>So, why would you pick one over the other? At the risk of oversimplifying, it comes down to <strong>ease-of-use</strong> and <strong>performance</strong>.</p><h3>Insertion, Deletion, Iteration, Updation</h3><p>What do I mean by ease-of-use? When we group data together, we usually want to <em>use</em> it in some way. Specifically, we want to <strong>add</strong> elements, <strong>remove</strong> them, <strong>access/update</strong> them, or <strong>iterate</strong> over each of them.</p><p><em>Side note: the person asking was using React, so immutability is a concern, which has an impact on ease-of-use/readability. Mutable methods like </em><em>push(), pop(), splice(), etc would make things simpler, but in these examples I’ll be thinking immutably. There are also a few different methods to achieve each of these examples (spread vs. </em><em>concat, for instance), but I’ll just stick to one method.</em></p><h4><strong>Insertion</strong></h4><p>Let’s say we have this array of names:</p><pre>const names = ['Bob', 'Cate'];</pre><p>We have a new name that we want to add one to either end. Easy!</p><pre>const namesPlusEnd = [...names, 'Deb'];<br>// ['Bob', 'Cate', 'Deb'];</pre><pre>const namesPlusStart = ['Axl', ...names];<br>// ['Axl', 'Bob', 'Cate'];</pre><p>But when we want to insert a name into the middle of an array, we need to know the index. We can’t insert something unless we know <em>where</em> it needs to go, so if we don’t have the index, we need to find it using Array.findIndex, which takes time to iterate though the array.</p><pre>const namesPlusMiddle = [<br>  ...names.slice(0, 1),<br>  'Bud',<br>  ...names.slice(1)<br>];</pre><pre>// ['Bob', 'Bud', 'Cate']</pre><p>Objects, on the other hand, don’t keep track of order, so it’s simple to add properties anywhere since there’s no concept of beginning/middle/end, and fast, since we don’t need to iterate:</p><pre>const box = { width: 4, height: 3, color: 'blue' };</pre><pre>If we care about immutability:<br>const newBox = { ...box, id: 42 };</pre><pre>Or, if we don't:<br>box.id = 42;</pre><pre>// box/newBox are both now:<br>// { width: 4, height: 3, color: 'blue', id: 42 };</pre><h4>Deletion</h4><p>What about removing items? Again, it depends! Easy to remove from the beginning or end of an array:</p><pre>const colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue'];</pre><pre>const colorsWithoutFirst = colors.slice(1);<br>// ['green', 'blue']</pre><pre>const colorsWithoutLast = colors.slice(0, -1);<br>// ['red', 'green']</pre><p>Also pretty easy from the middle, but again, you need to know the index you want removed (in this case index 1), or iterate through to filter out the value:</p><pre>const colorsMinusMid = [...colors.slice(0, 1), ...colors.slice(2)];<br>// ['red', 'blue']</pre><pre>const colorsMinusGreen = colors.filter(color => color !== 'green');<br>// ['red', 'blue']</pre><p>Like adding a property to an object, removing an object property is simple no matter where in the object (since there’s not really a concept of ‘where’ something is in an object).</p><pre>Immutably:<br>const { color, ...colorlessBox } = box;</pre><pre>With mutation:<br>delete box.color;</pre><pre>colorlessBox/box are both now:<br>// { height: 4, width: 3, id: 42 }</pre><h4>Updation</h4><p>Updation - not a real word. When we want to update an element in an array, we can do it by index, or if we don’t know the index we can iterate over it looking for the element based on the element’s value (or a property on the element). Updating via iteration is common, since we often deal with large sets of data where we don’t know the index, or dynamic data where the index can change.</p><pre>const fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'clementine'];</pre><pre>const newFruits = [<br>  ...fruits.slice(0, 1),<br>  'watermelon',<br>   ...fruits.slice(1)<br>];</pre><pre>This is a little simpler, and leaves the fruits array unchanged:<br>const fruitsCopy = fruits.slice();<br>fruitsCopy[1] = 'watermelon';</pre><pre>Or, if we don't know the index:<br>const newFruits = fruits.map(fruit => {<br>  if (fruit === 'banana') return 'watermelon';<br>  return fruit;<br>});</pre><pre>// ['apple', 'watermelon', 'clementine'];</pre><p>Updating an object, once again, is much more straightforward:</p><pre>const box = { height: 4, width: 3, color: 'blue' };</pre><pre>Immutably:<br>const redBox = { ...box, color: 'red' };</pre><pre>Mutably:<br>box.color = 'red';</pre><pre>// box/newBox are both now:<br>// { height: 4, width: 3, color: 'red' }</pre><h4>Accessing Elements</h4><p>If you just need to get the value of an element in an array (without updating it), it’s simple if you know the index, and not much harder if you don’t (but you know something about the element you’re looking for):</p><pre>const fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'clementine'];</pre><pre>const secondFruit = fruits[1];<br>// 'banana'</pre><pre>const clementine = fruits.find(fruit => fruit === 'clementine');<br>// 'clementine'</pre><p>Accessing object properties is easy too:</p><pre>const box = { width: 4, height: 3, color: 'blue' };</pre><pre>const boxColor = box.color<br>// 'blue'</pre><h4>Iteration and methods</h4><p>So far, arrays have been kind of a drag compared to objects. Doing anything with a single array element requires that you know the index, or requires a bit more code. Finally, with iteration, it’s time for the array to shine. When you want do do some transformation to the elements as a batch, arrays are designed for this:</p><pre>const fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'clementine'];</pre><pre>const capitalFruits = fruits.map(fruit => fruit.toUpperCase());<br>// ['APPLE', 'BANANA', 'CLEMENTINE']</pre><pre>fruits.forEach(fruit => console.log(fruit));<br>// 'apple'<br>// 'banana'<br>// 'clementine'</pre><pre>Iteration is common in React:<br>const FruitsList = props => (<br>  <ul><br>    {props.fruits.map(fruit => <li>{fruit}</li>)}<br>  </ul><br>);<br>// <ul><br>//   <li>apple</li><br>//   <li>banana</li><br>//   <li>clementine</li><br>// </ul></pre><p>To iterate over an object, our only real option is a for...in loop, but (in my opinion) it’s often simpler/more readable to just… convert it to an array. Object.keys/values/entries iterates over the keys, values, or both, and gives us an array of that data:</p><pre>const box = { height: 4, width: 3, color: 'blue' };</pre><pre>const BoxProperties = ({ box }) => (<br>  <ul><br>    Object.keys(box).map(prop => <li>{prop}: {box[prop]}</li>);<br>  </ul><br>);<br>// <ul><br>//   <li>height: 4</li><br>//   <li>width: 3</li><br>//   <li>color: blue</li><br>// </ul></pre><p>Arrays also have other methods that allow you to work with the data, which objects don’t have:</p><pre>const animalNames = ['ant', 'bird', 'centipede', 'demogorgon'];</pre><pre>animalNames.reverse();<br>// ['demogorgon', 'centipede', 'bird', 'ant']</pre><pre>const shortNames = animalNames.filter(name => name.length < 5);<br>// ['ant', 'bird'];</pre><pre>const containsB = animalNames.some(name => name.includes('b'));<br>// true</pre><pre>const allAreLong = animalNames.every(name => name.length > 3);<br>// false</pre><pre>const totalLetters = animalNames.reduce((total, name) => {<br>  return total + name.length;<br>}, 0);<br>// 26</pre><p>You could implement any of these pretty easily with for...in, but arrays have them out of the box.</p><h4>Performance</h4><p>Speed isn’t always a consideration, but when it is there can be a big difference between arrays and objects. There are plenty of resources on the internet about array vs. object performance, but briefly: array manipulation is slower when you don’t know the index (<em>linear time</em>, or O(<em>n</em>)), because you have to iterate over each element until you find the one you’re looking to use. If you do know the index and immutability isn’t a concern, you don’t need to iterate and can access/update the element at that index quickly (<em>constant time</em>, or O(1)). Object property lookup/update/insertion/deletion happens quickly (also <em>constant time</em>) because the property name gives you a reference so you don’t have to go looking for the element you want.</p><h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4><p>The rule of thumb is: groups of similarly typed data, which you need ordered or want to manipulate as a batch are better suited for arrays, and grouped properties of a single entity are better suited for objects. Using the right data type isn’t <em>always</em> a clear choice, but the more you work with each data type, the more obvious it will be which one makes sense in any given situation.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=3c1f895907bd\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/practical-javascript-arrays-vs-objects-3c1f895907bd\">Practical JavaScript: Arrays vs. Objects</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com\">Towards Data Science</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

Fetch is a tool in JavaScript that lets you get data from other websites. It can also help you make new data, change old data, and delete data too. It’s important to know how to use it because it can help you work with things outside of your website.</p><p>In this blog, we’ll explore what the Fetch API is, how to use it, and provide some best practices to keep in mind when using it.</p><h3>What is the Fetch API?</h3><p>The Fetch API is a modern JavaScript API for retrieving resources across the network. The Fetch API is built into modern web browsers and provides a simple interface for fetching resources. It uses Promises to make asynchronous requests.</p><h3>How to Use the Fetch API</h3><p>To use the Fetch API, you start by calling the fetch() function, passing in the URL you want to fetch from. The fetch() function returns a Promise that resolves with a Response object. You can then use the methods on the Response object to access the data you want.</p><h3>Best Practices</h3><p>Here are some best practices to keep in mind when using the Fetch API:</p><ol><li>Always check for errors: When making a request, it’s important to handle errors correctly. You can check the ok property of the Response object to see if the request was successful. If it wasn’t, you can handle the error by throwing an error or logging an error message.</li><li>Always parse the response: If you’re retrieving data from a server, it’s important to parse the response correctly. You can use the json(), text(), or blob() methods on the Response object to parse the response into the format you need.</li><li>Use async/await: Async/await is a newer feature in JavaScript that makes it easier to write asynchronous code. You can use async/await with the Fetch API to make your code more readable and maintainable.</li></ol><h3>Performing GET Requests</h3><p>Here’s an example of how to use the Fetch API to retrieve some JSON data:</p><pre>fetch('http://localhost:3000/toys') <br>.then(response => response.json()) <br>.then(data => console.log(data));</pre><p>In this example, we’re using the fetch() function to retrieve some data from the toys API. We’re calling the json() method on the Response object to parse the data as JSON, and then logging it to the console.</p><h3>Performing POST Requests</h3><p>POST requests are used to send data to a server. This is commonly used for creating new resources or updating existing ones. Here’s an example of how to make a POST request using Fetch:</p><pre>fetch(\"http://localhost:3000/toys\", {<br>headers: {<br>\"Content-Type\": \"application/json\",<br>\"Accept\": \"application/json\",<br>},<br>method: \"POST\",<br>body: JSON.stringify({<br>name: e.target['name'].value,<br>image: e.target['image'].value,<br>likes: 0<br>})<br>})<br>.then((res) => res.json())<br>.then((toy) => {renderToy(toy)})<br>console.log(e.target['name'].value)</pre><p>In this example, we create an object called data that contains the toy image and name. We then use the Fetch API to make a POST request to <a href=\"http://localhost:3000/toys,\">http://localhost:3000/toys,</a> and we pass in the method, headers, and body options.

Fetch is a tool in JavaScript that lets you get data from other websites. It can also help you make new data, change old data, and delete data too. It’s important to know how to use it because it can help you work with things outside of your website.</p><p>In this blog, we’ll explore what the Fetch API is, how to use it, and provide some best practices to keep in mind when using it.</p><h3>What is the Fetch API?</h3><p>The Fetch API is a modern JavaScript API for retrieving resources across the network. The Fetch API is built into modern web browsers and provides a simple interface for fetching resources. It uses Promises to make asynchronous requests.</p><h3>How to Use the Fetch API</h3><p>To use the Fetch API, you start by calling the fetch() function, passing in the URL you want to fetch from. The fetch() function returns a Promise that resolves with a Response object. You can then use the methods on the Response object to access the data you want.</p><h3>Best Practices</h3><p>Here are some best practices to keep in mind when using the Fetch API:</p><ol><li>Always check for errors: When making a request, it’s important to handle errors correctly. You can check the ok property of the Response object to see if the request was successful. If it wasn’t, you can handle the error by throwing an error or logging an error message.</li><li>Always parse the response: If you’re retrieving data from a server, it’s important to parse the response correctly. You can use the json(), text(), or blob() methods on the Response object to parse the response into the format you need.</li><li>Use async/await: Async/await is a newer feature in JavaScript that makes it easier to write asynchronous code. You can use async/await with the Fetch API to make your code more readable and maintainable.</li></ol><h3>Performing GET Requests</h3><p>Here’s an example of how to use the Fetch API to retrieve some JSON data:</p><pre>fetch('http://localhost:3000/toys') <br>.then(response => response.json()) <br>.then(data => console.log(data));</pre><p>In this example, we’re using the fetch() function to retrieve some data from the toys API. We’re calling the json() method on the Response object to parse the data as JSON, and then logging it to the console.</p><h3>Performing POST Requests</h3><p>POST requests are used to send data to a server. This is commonly used for creating new resources or updating existing ones. Here’s an example of how to make a POST request using Fetch:</p><pre>fetch(\"http://localhost:3000/toys\", {<br>headers: {<br>\"Content-Type\": \"application/json\",<br>\"Accept\": \"application/json\",<br>},<br>method: \"POST\",<br>body: JSON.stringify({<br>name: e.target['name'].value,<br>image: e.target['image'].value,<br>likes: 0<br>})<br>})<br>.then((res) => res.json())<br>.then((toy) => {renderToy(toy)})<br>console.log(e.target['name'].value)</pre><p>In this example, we create an object called data that contains the toy image and name. We then use the Fetch API to make a POST request to <a href=\"http://localhost:3000/toys,\">http://localhost:3000/toys,</a> and we pass in the method, headers, and body options. We also use the json() method to parse the response data, and lastly, we render an object and log the data to the console.</p><h3>Deleting Data with DELETE</h3><p>DELETE requests are used to remove existing resources from a server. Here’s an example of how to make a DELETE request using Fetch:</p><pre>fetch(`http://localhost:3000/toys/${id}`, {<br>method: \"DELETE\"})<br>.then(res => res.json())<br>.then(()=> {toyCard.remove()})<br>})</pre><p>In this example we are removing an object from the json file, then once the promise comes back, remove the element from the page so it updates in real time.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>The Fetch API is a powerful tool that makes it easy to retrieve data from servers in your JavaScript code. With its simple interface and use of Promises, it’s a great way to write asynchronous code.</p><p>As a beginner, it’s important to take the time to learn the basics of the Fetch API and understand best practices for using it.
