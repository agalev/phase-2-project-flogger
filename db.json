The idea that one could acquire the skills needed to enter the software industry in a matter of weeks, not years, is very alluring to outsiders. But how efficient are those programs and how successful are their graduates? To answer these questions, we need to factor for the quality of the bootcamp, as well as preparedness & motivation of the candidate.</p><h3>Before the bootcamp</h3><p>It’s no secret to anyone the vast list of reasons why you would want to become a software engineer: high compensation, remote work, good work/life balance etc. But in my opinion these reasons attract people that would normally not enjoy sitting on a computer, staring at a screen, solving bugs, coming with solutions all day long. My recommendation to prospective candidates would be to take a few beginner courses on programming and get a feel of the material. That way, they can prepare for the possibility of enrolling into a program, while at the same time they can make a decision if coding is actually something they are genuinely interested in.</p><h3>Choosing the bootcamp</h3><p>There are so many programs out there, some of them good, most of them bad, and it can feel overwhelming when it comes to making a choice. It’s kind of like buying a car — you need to trust that it will be reliable and also that you’ll enjoy its features. You have probably heard the saying “you get what you pay for” and this is true in the coding bootcamp world as well. Some of the programs are very expensive, but they just happen to have the best results when it comes to job placement post-graduation. There’s different styles and intensity: some have a remote “live” format where you tune in virtually for lectures, have access to a chat to connect with your cohort. Others might be having slower intensity, also known as a “flex” format. The idea with that is that you’d be self-paced. Usually that means it would take longer time to go through the curriculum. Another format is an in-person program. That means you would have a classroom setting with instructors and your peers, which makes for easy collaboration. My advice:</p><ol><li>Choose a stack of technologies that you believe will have the best prospects in the future. Then stick with it until you learn the fundamentals of software development. Things move fast in the coding world and what tech was used 5 years ago may not be what’s used today. Our goal as software engineers is to adapt quickly to changes and never be left behind.</li><li>Choose the intensity that best suits your learning style and life situation. Sure it would be nice to finish in the least amount of time, but if that means you would be skimming through the material just to pass the challenges and tests, it might not be the best idea.</li></ol><h3>Attending the Bootcamp</h3><p>Ok, you have done some courses and have decided that, maybe, coding is for you. You have done your due diligence and have settled on a program that you like. What now?</p><ol><li>Show up everyday. This rings especially true for the live programs that have a higher intensity. Don’t let yesterday’s work be left for tomorrow, because soon enough you will find yourself overwhelmed and that’s not cool.</li><li>Take care of your mental and physical state! Can’t stress this enough. Eat food. Drink water. Go to bed early. Limit partying to Friday/Saturday. Take walks regularly. The mere fact of you being outside, breathing fresh air, (hopefully) basking in some sunshine, not staring at pixels will do wonders for your brain and your capacity to absorb info.</li><li>Give it your 100%! It’s time to prove to yourself that through vigor and enthusiasm, you can accomplish great things.</li></ol><h3>After Graduation</h3><p>You’ve done the hard part! Or have you? Well, it’s time you dip your feet in the cold water, a.k.a the job market. Start applying for jobs. Looking for a job is a full-time endeavor. Treat it as such. You will need to excel in order to secure a position. This means that the work is not done. You need to keep building upon your skills and improving. Keep working on your projects. As a bootcamp grad and not having any past experience, your projects are the single most important aspect of your education. Make sure you have at least 1 really well polished project that you have built from the grounds up. Make sure you can talk about it at length and explain the flow of data across the application. Don’t give up! It might get discouraging after a few rejections. But take every turn down as a learning opportunity: figure out where you lacked and improve. Be patient, keep at it and you shall be rewarded.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=be3f33cd7c37\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">",

Her role then as a broadcaster is to guide her guest through their own story instead of telling it for them.</p><p>What was surprising to me was to learn that Susan never prepares questions in advance. She walks into a conversation or interview with curiosity rather than preparation. She trusts that the guest knows their story best and she focuses on getting them to share it without a preconceived notion.</p><blockquote>“Most of the stories that I do end up not being at all what I thought they are going to be. I take that as a good sign. I go into it thinking–well, I am going to find out about X, and actually, if I’m really open, and really listening, and really paying attention, the real story emerges. The one that I couldn’t have anticipated. And that’s what I’m following.”</blockquote><p>The crucial skill to be successful with this approach is to be a fast thinker:</p><blockquote>“Being good at thinking on your feet is essential, because you’re diving into something you don’t know what you’ll encounter.”</blockquote><p>On the question whether or not she uses quotes verbatim, she replies, passionately:</p><blockquote>“Oh yeah, oh yeah! I cannot state strongly enough that is utterly totally unethical. It’s a lie. If you put a line in quotation marks and attribute to someone something they actually didn’t say, it’s a lie. It’s an absolute lie. If you didn’t quite get all the words of the quote down, then paraphrase it. If you feel sure you know the intent of what they said, but the quote isn’t–you didn’t get the words down, paraphrase it. I feel strongly about it.”</blockquote><p>Her secret pro tip to interviewing that all interviewers should master: listening.</p><blockquote>“Be a listener. Be a good listener. And sit with your discomfort, which is part of what listening requires. Those long silences, the moments where you aren’t exactly sure what you’re doing or a person is not responding right away. It’s not easy but you have to learn to live with that and listen and be in the moment.”</blockquote><h3>Ira Glass</h3><p><a href=\"http://www.maximumfun.org/turnaround/ira-glass\"><em>Ira Glass</em></a><em> is a public radio personality and the host and producer of </em><a href=\"https://www.thisamericanlife.org\"><em>This American Life</em></a><em>.</em></p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*HofD28ErmTjALru6htcwQw.jpeg\" /></figure><p>Almost exactly the opposite approach to Susan, Ira Glass is always prepared.

      "content": "<p><em>One of the hardest things I learned from 8 years at SoundCloud was to transition from being an individual contributor to becoming a manager and eventually a leader in the senior management team of a company of 350+ employees.</em></p><p>Here are 10 things I learned from 8 years at SoundCloud (hint: #10 is my personal favorite):</p><h3>#1 Build a system, not an empire</h3><p>Empires need control, expansion, and defense. Systems, when built correctly, can sustain themselves, run autonomously and evolve through the contribution of its… well, contributors. My role as a leader was to build a system, not an empire.</p><p>Building a system meant to identify the pieces needed to fulfill a certain purpose, to assemble all the parts necessary (standards, people, processes, policies, etc) to fulfill it, and then to remove myself from the system I built as fast as possible to see if it can outlive me without falling apart. If it could, my job was done and I could move on to the next purpose. If it couldn’t, I had to step back into it and make sure all the right pieces were in place and make some adjustments.</p><h3>#2 Your company values do not mean a thing unless your leaders fully embody them</h3><p>I am a mission and values-driven leader and I believe that the right set of values can be a powerful instrument to consult for guidance. The important (and often hardest) part about company values is to break them from an aspirational level to a practical level. When lived properly, you will witness a behavior and be able to link it to one of your company’s values.</p><p>At SoundCloud, I had the privilege of being involved in developing our first set of of values and then recently of leading the effort to refresh our values and I’ve seen first-hand how powerful values can be as a leadership tool.</p><p>Effective (and successful) leaders, I’ve found, embody all of your company’s values entirely, and then model how those values are lived day in, day out, on a behavioral level. You don’t badge values, you live them.</p><h3>#3 “Be impeccable with your word”</h3><p>This is a sentence borrowed from the book ‘<a href=\"http://www.toltecspirit.com/\">The Four Agreements’ by Don Miguel Ruiz</a> and describes what is referred to in a work setting as accountability. Do what you say you will do. Say something, commit to it, communicate it, do it, report back to close the loop. It’s an obvious trait of great leaders but is often easier said than done.</p><p>To be a great leader, find a process that works for you to hold yourself (and others!) accountable. What works for me, for example, is to use my calendar as a reminder and to add follow-up notes. Super easy and low effort once you get into the swing.</p><h3>#4 Become a context-gathering and context-distributing machine</h3><p>In a fast-paced environment, context trumps control. If you invest heavily in hiring and retaining the best talent–and expect them to do their best work–equip them with all the context and information you have. If you entrust your people with all the information they need to do their job, it will enable them to do their best work autonomously.</p><p>Provide your people–consistently and continuously–with context and information about strategy, priorities, decisions, changes, and resources and they will go and deliver great work. From One-on-Ones to company All Hands meetings, use every opportunity to provide context.</p><h3>#5 Practice radical self-inquiry</h3><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/jerrycolonna\">Jerry Colonna</a> is a coach we have worked with at SoundCloud and who helps leaders, executives, and founders unlock their full potential. In working with leaders, Jerry uses the term called <a href=\"https://www.reboot.io/about/coaches/\">“radical self-inquiry”</a>, a deep exploration of self. This — often scary — journey requires the leader to be open and transparent, to be self-aware, and most importantly, to be honest to themselves.</p><p>The leaders I have seen being successful all have demonstrated the willingness to be or become aware leaders–aware of their strengths and styles, their weaknesses and fears, and able to verbalize them in a productive and positive way.</p><h3>#6 Don’t solve problems. Instead, enable problem-solvers</h3><p>As a contributor you contribute, you solve problems, you’re the doer. As a manager or leader that suddenly changes and it can be the most counter-intuitive transition you face. Suddenly your job is to stop doing and instead, to enable the doing. The reason this is counter-intuitive is because you associate much of the value you create as an employee with what you do. And when you become a manager, the value suddenly shifts to a different kind of doing, which feels more detached from the actual work. The faster you can transition through this dynamic, the better it is for your team.</p><p>Great leaders don’t just sit on the sidelines and point to the problems, great leaders step up and mobilize their people to find and implement a solution.</p><h3>#7 Ask great questions…</h3><p>Great leaders ask great questions. Most often, people have the answers inside them, they just need someone to help them get to them. Instead of telling people what to do, they ask questions to help people think through a problem. In other words, they coach people through a situation rather than prescribing a solution. For example:</p><ul><li><em>What would you do?</em></li><li><em>What do you think are our options here?</em></li><li><em>What do you want to achieve?</em></li><li><em>What would be the fastest and cheapest way to solve this problem?</em></li></ul><p>The best book I’ve read that teaches a framework to use the coaching method as a leader is called ‘<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Quiet-Leadership-Steps-Transforming-Performance/dp/0060835915\">Quiet Leadership’ by David Rock</a>. This is the book I have gifted most.</p><h3>#8 … Then shut up and listen</h3><p>Listening is not waiting until the other person is done speaking. Great leaders not only speak with intent, they also listen with intent. They are active listeners. Good listeners not only hear what is being said, they understand what people mean. And they have developed a way to play it back in their own words without altering the initial meaning, or by adding their own opinion and filters, or by putting a judgement on the person. For example:</p><ul><li><em>What I heard you say is…</em></li><li><em>Am I getting it right that…</em></li><li><em>The three things that I take away from what you just said are… Am I missing anything that is important to you?</em></li></ul><p>One of the most powerful listening exercises I did during a leadership training was to listen to the other person speak for 10 minutes. This is a long time. The rules were to not interrupt, to not “mhm”, and to maintain eye contact. After completing the 10 minutes, I remembered all of the key things the person shared with me and could mirror them back. I had been fully present and attentive.</p><h3>#9 Be a people- and dot-connector</h3><p>Similarly to #4 in gathering and distributing context, as a leader you must connect with people, connect people with one another, and help people connect the dots. Successful leaders reach beyond their teams and organizations and establish healthy relationships across the business (aka break through the silos). They become relationship brokers, connectors, internal community builders. For example:</p><blockquote>“Diana, I was just speaking with Lucy in Marketing about a campaign that she is developing and I think you would find value in connecting and discussing this with her. Do you want me to ask Lucy if she’s open to connect with you about it? Perhaps there is a way for you two to collaborate.”</blockquote><p>You don’t need to identify as an extrovert to be a good connector. In fact, I’ve witnessed leaders who identify as introverts often to be to more thoughtful connectors and relationship builders.</p><p>Connecting people with one another is particularly important when integrating new employees. A great tool to use is to map out the new employee’s internal network and then broker introductions to help your new team member establish and foster healthy work relationships.</p><h3>#10. Find and use your personal fingerprint</h3><p>This lesson is one of my favorite ones because you can get creative and add a personal touch: pick your signature leadership fingerprint. My personal fingerprint as a leader was to extend small, meaningful, and honest gestures whenever I had the chance to.</p><p>For example, whenever one of my team members’ parents would visit the office, I would stop for a moment, say “Hello” to introduce myself, and then tell their parents about something great their son or daughter had done for the company, and that they can be proud of them. Another one is that I used to send someone on a different team an email and thank them for something they did, completely unexpected. Often I would forget about these gestures and someone would tell me years later that it made a huge difference for them and they never forgot. Small, meaningful, and honest gestures can have a huge and long-lasting impact.</p><p>Leadership is hard, and it can be scary. But what every company needs (and the world right now, it seems), are people who are willing to lead.</p><p>You don’t need permission to be a leader.</p><h3>Liked this?

      "content_encoded": "<p><em>One of the hardest things I learned from 8 years at SoundCloud was to transition from being an individual contributor to becoming a manager and eventually a leader in the senior management team of a company of 350+ employees.</em></p><p>Here are 10 things I learned from 8 years at SoundCloud (hint: #10 is my personal favorite):</p><h3>#1 Build a system, not an empire</h3><p>Empires need control, expansion, and defense. Systems, when built correctly, can sustain themselves, run autonomously and evolve through the contribution of its… well, contributors. My role as a leader was to build a system, not an empire.</p><p>Building a system meant to identify the pieces needed to fulfill a certain purpose, to assemble all the parts necessary (standards, people, processes, policies, etc) to fulfill it, and then to remove myself from the system I built as fast as possible to see if it can outlive me without falling apart. If it could, my job was done and I could move on to the next purpose. If it couldn’t, I had to step back into it and make sure all the right pieces were in place and make some adjustments.</p><h3>#2 Your company values do not mean a thing unless your leaders fully embody them</h3><p>I am a mission and values-driven leader and I believe that the right set of values can be a powerful instrument to consult for guidance. The important (and often hardest) part about company values is to break them from an aspirational level to a practical level. When lived properly, you will witness a behavior and be able to link it to one of your company’s values.</p><p>At SoundCloud, I had the privilege of being involved in developing our first set of of values and then recently of leading the effort to refresh our values and I’ve seen first-hand how powerful values can be as a leadership tool.</p><p>Effective (and successful) leaders, I’ve found, embody all of your company’s values entirely, and then model how those values are lived day in, day out, on a behavioral level. You don’t badge values, you live them.</p><h3>#3 “Be impeccable with your word”</h3><p>This is a sentence borrowed from the book ‘<a href=\"http://www.toltecspirit.com/\">The Four Agreements’ by Don Miguel Ruiz</a> and describes what is referred to in a work setting as accountability. Do what you say you will do. Say something, commit to it, communicate it, do it, report back to close the loop. It’s an obvious trait of great leaders but is often easier said than done.</p><p>To be a great leader, find a process that works for you to hold yourself (and others!) accountable. What works for me, for example, is to use my calendar as a reminder and to add follow-up notes. Super easy and low effort once you get into the swing.</p><h3>#4 Become a context-gathering and context-distributing machine</h3><p>In a fast-paced environment, context trumps control. If you invest heavily in hiring and retaining the best talent–and expect them to do their best work–equip them with all the context and information you have. If you entrust your people with all the information they need to do their job, it will enable them to do their best work autonomously.</p><p>Provide your people–consistently and continuously–with context and information about strategy, priorities, decisions, changes, and resources and they will go and deliver great work. From One-on-Ones to company All Hands meetings, use every opportunity to provide context.</p><h3>#5 Practice radical self-inquiry</h3><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/jerrycolonna\">Jerry Colonna</a> is a coach we have worked with at SoundCloud and who helps leaders, executives, and founders unlock their full potential. In working with leaders, Jerry uses the term called <a href=\"https://www.reboot.io/about/coaches/\">“radical self-inquiry”</a>, a deep exploration of self. This — often scary — journey requires the leader to be open and transparent, to be self-aware, and most importantly, to be honest to themselves.</p><p>The leaders I have seen being successful all have demonstrated the willingness to be or become aware leaders–aware of their strengths and styles, their weaknesses and fears, and able to verbalize them in a productive and positive way.</p><h3>#6 Don’t solve problems. Instead, enable problem-solvers</h3><p>As a contributor you contribute, you solve problems, you’re the doer. As a manager or leader that suddenly changes and it can be the most counter-intuitive transition you face. Suddenly your job is to stop doing and instead, to enable the doing. The reason this is counter-intuitive is because you associate much of the value you create as an employee with what you do. And when you become a manager, the value suddenly shifts to a different kind of doing, which feels more detached from the actual work. The faster you can transition through this dynamic, the better it is for your team.</p><p>Great leaders don’t just sit on the sidelines and point to the problems, great leaders step up and mobilize their people to find and implement a solution.</p><h3>#7 Ask great questions…</h3><p>Great leaders ask great questions. Most often, people have the answers inside them, they just need someone to help them get to them. Instead of telling people what to do, they ask questions to help people think through a problem. In other words, they coach people through a situation rather than prescribing a solution. For example:</p><ul><li><em>What would you do?</em></li><li><em>What do you think are our options here?</em></li><li><em>What do you want to achieve?</em></li><li><em>What would be the fastest and cheapest way to solve this problem?</em></li></ul><p>The best book I’ve read that teaches a framework to use the coaching method as a leader is called ‘<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Quiet-Leadership-Steps-Transforming-Performance/dp/0060835915\">Quiet Leadership’ by David Rock</a>. This is the book I have gifted most.</p><h3>#8 … Then shut up and listen</h3><p>Listening is not waiting until the other person is done speaking. Great leaders not only speak with intent, they also listen with intent. They are active listeners. Good listeners not only hear what is being said, they understand what people mean. And they have developed a way to play it back in their own words without altering the initial meaning, or by adding their own opinion and filters, or by putting a judgement on the person. For example:</p><ul><li><em>What I heard you say is…</em></li><li><em>Am I getting it right that…</em></li><li><em>The three things that I take away from what you just said are… Am I missing anything that is important to you?</em></li></ul><p>One of the most powerful listening exercises I did during a leadership training was to listen to the other person speak for 10 minutes. This is a long time. The rules were to not interrupt, to not “mhm”, and to maintain eye contact. After completing the 10 minutes, I remembered all of the key things the person shared with me and could mirror them back. I had been fully present and attentive.</p><h3>#9 Be a people- and dot-connector</h3><p>Similarly to #4 in gathering and distributing context, as a leader you must connect with people, connect people with one another, and help people connect the dots. Successful leaders reach beyond their teams and organizations and establish healthy relationships across the business (aka break through the silos). They become relationship brokers, connectors, internal community builders. For example:</p><blockquote>“Diana, I was just speaking with Lucy in Marketing about a campaign that she is developing and I think you would find value in connecting and discussing this with her. Do you want me to ask Lucy if she’s open to connect with you about it? Perhaps there is a way for you two to collaborate.”</blockquote><p>You don’t need to identify as an extrovert to be a good connector. In fact, I’ve witnessed leaders who identify as introverts often to be to more thoughtful connectors and relationship builders.</p><p>Connecting people with one another is particularly important when integrating new employees. A great tool to use is to map out the new employee’s internal network and then broker introductions to help your new team member establish and foster healthy work relationships.</p><h3>#10.

We learned a hard lesson once we defined our values: the importance of communicating and embedding them so that they become a framework for guiding decision-making and consultation as well as a neutral instrument to encourage behaviors that are <em>on</em> culture and <em>on</em> values.

No exceptions.</li><li>For over a decade, I smoked about 30 cigarettes a day. A day!</li><li>I was known for always carrying cigarettes. Some friends even admitted that they didn’t buy cigarettes because they knew I’d always have some.</li><li>I considered smoking a cigarette the highlight of a great meal.</li><li>I was loyal to one cigarette brand in a way I wasn’t to any other brand of anything.</li></ul><p>Put simply, I loved smoking. I was convinced that it made me more attractive, more rebellious, and that smoking helped me fit in with people I wanted to hang out with.</p><p>Of course, aside from loving cigarettes, I was addicted to them. Nicotine is a powerful little devil. I tried to quit twice and failed.</p><p>I was what they call a “heavy smoker”. So was my mom. She died unexpectedly and suddenly in the early morning hours of November 11, 2012. The cause of her death has not directly been linked to the smoking, but it was clear that the smoking had affected her health.</p><p>In January 2013, I travelled to a small eco hut resort and a deserted beach along the Caribbean coast in Colombia. It was the first time since my mom passed that I had been by myself. It was hard. The support of family and friends had kept me in a haze and had distracted me from dealing with the pain of the loss. Now, I cried a lot. I slept a lot. I wrote a lot. I smoked a lot. The pain was a pain that I had never felt before. It had no measure. It was a new pain. It was like feeling all the feelings, and all the emotions all at the same time, in a constant non-orchestrated overdrive.</p><h4>Thinking It Through</h4><p>It was a new year. It was Year One without my mom. My thoughts steered away from new year’s resolutions. I had always been bad at defining — and more importantly sticking to — resolutions. So I never defined them in the first place.</p><p>A question kept bugging me that I’d asked a friend a few days earlier: <em>“Can you train willpower?”</em>. Her answer was that if you think of willpower as a muscle, you can in fact train it.</p><p>To me, quitting smoking had always been a question of willpower. Turns out that was only half of the truth.</p><p>From willpower, I moved on to listing a set of personal growth challenges. They included the usual classics of new year’s resolutions, including “quit smoking”. I moved it to the top of the list. It felt uncomfortable and scary.</p><blockquote>To quit smoking.</blockquote><p>To quit smoking describes to stop a behavior. To change a habit. To stop a bad habit. Changing habits is hard. In particular those that involve an addiction. Knowing that I found it difficult to stick to resolutions, I wanted to be sure that I could succeed at something that I had elevated to the top of the list.</p><h4>The Breakthrough</h4><p>How could I be successful at quitting a habit that I loved, and a habit that I was addicted to? A habit that I had tried and failed to stop twice before.</p><p>And then It hit me.</p><p><strong>It was not about changing a habit, it was about changing who I am.</strong></p><p>Smoking was part of my identity. I was known for it. It was who I am. I was a smoker.</p><p>I started another list and wrote down what kind of person I wanted to be in the future. The list included many traits and habits of a person I could imagine myself to be one day. Nowhere on this list did it say “smoker”.</p><p>I was on to something. Our identity defines our behaviors. Who we are defines what we do. My future self was not a smoker. Hence, I would not smoke. But which future? Short-, mid-, or long-term future?</p><p>The answer: January 11th. Three months to the day after my mom had passed. I had 5 days. It was an important date. It would be the day that I would transform my identify from smoker to non-smoker. It was exhilarating and excruciating at the same time.</p><p>Enter willpower. Willpower became my companion to prepare to become a non-smoker. I defined micro-goals: I started with an allowance of 5 cigarettes that I could smoke at specific times throughout the day. Every day, I removed one cigarette from the allowance. I decided that I would smoke the last cigarette in a small ceremony on the beach on my last night as a smoker.</p><p>I smoked my last cigarette in the evening on January 10th. The next morning I woke up a non-smoker.</p><h4>Anticipating Obstacles</h4><p>That day, I woke up proud and determined. I was convinced that if I could make it through this first day, every next day would be possible too.</p><p>One thing that smokers will tell you is that they love smoking when they drink alcohol. People who usually don’t smoke will smoke the occasional cigarette in social situations from time to time. I knew that the combination of cigarettes and alcohol was a great one so I wanted to stress-test my new identity by putting myself out there.</p><p>I was still in Colombia and joined a group of backpackers out to party. We drank and we laughed and we danced. People around me smoked. Many did. I became more aware of people smoking. Only a few days prior and I would have smoked to enjoy the party. That night, though, was different. I sat there, smiling, realizing that I was a non-smoker now and that I was enjoying the party regardless.</p><p>Shortly after midnight I went to bed. I had made it through my first day (and party!) as a non-smoker.</p><p>Another thing that smokers say is that they fear that they will gain weight by compensating the loss of cigarettes with more food or candy. Knowing that, I overcame this fear by working with a trainer to design a nutrition and exercise plan for the next three months. Working with somebody was key because it made me accountable to myself <em>and</em> my trainer.</p><h4>The Impact</h4><p>A week after becoming a non-smoker, I had almost forgotten that I used to smoke 30 cigarettes a day. Two weeks later, it was strange to think that I had ever been a smoker.</p><p>My cough disappeared, my immune system got more resilient, my skin started to look healthier. I could breathe. Exercising became easier, fun even.</p><p>Life got simpler; I did not have to worry about carrying cigarettes. No need to inhale 2–3 cigarettes in a row before entering an airport or having to deal with the anxieties of a long-haul flight. Enjoying a meal at a restaurant was not interrupted by cigarette breaks. It was liberating.</p><p>Most importantly, I had discovered something about myself that I didn’t believe to be true: that I have the ability to change for the better. And most surprisingly, I am still shocked about how easy it turns out to have been.</p><p>Becoming a non-smoker has unlocked more potential for change. I apply the same principle (<em>“define your identity and the habits will follow”</em>) in other aspects of my life (more on that in a future post).</p><p>On this day today three years ago, I became a non-smoker. That’s more than 30,000 cigarettes not smoked! I have not craved a cigarette once. I will not smoke a cigarette again. Because I am a non-smoker. And non-smokers don’t smoke.</p><h4>Ten Steps to Becoming a Non-Smoker</h4><p>If you too want to become a non-smoker, here are the following 10 steps that worked for me:</p><ol><li>Write about yourself in the third person. List who you want to be in the future.</li><li>Select the one thing that feels scariest and most uncomfortable: “be a non-smoker.”</li><li>Describe and visualize the behaviors of that person — what they do and don’t do.</li><li>Pick a day in the near future. If you can, pick a symbolic date — it’s motivating.</li><li>Train your willpower: set a daily allowance of cigarettes for specific times of the day. Enjoy them consciously. Remove one each day.</li><li>Address all your inner voices and <em>“What Ifs?”</em> head-on: <em>what if I gain weight? What if I drink? What if I just smoke one here and there? </em>Become aware of them by writing them down. The voices are just that… voices.</li><li>Come the day, celebrate your last cigarette. Don’t be scared, everything will be all right. Congratulations, you are a non-smoker now.</li><li>Put yourself in social situations in which you enjoyed smoking. Become aware of the situation and start noticing how you are a different person now. Feeling proud? You can be!</li><li>Find something that you enjoy to compensate. For me it was learning about nutrition and exercise. I worked with a personal trainer for 10 sessions before going solo. And in my second year as a non-smoker, I ran three half marathons!</li><li>When in doubt, remember the core principle: <strong>who you are defines what you do.</strong></li></ol><p>If I could do it, anyone can.</p><p>—</p><p><em>A big Thank You to </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/jhedelstein\"><em>Jean Edelstein</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/dianakimball\"><em>Diana Kimball</em></a><em> for the feedback and help on this post.</em></p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=a32fb6e2d5e2\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">",
